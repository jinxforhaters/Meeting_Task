Sakshi, we need someone to fix the critical login bug that’s been blocking users since yesterday.\nMohit, can you optimize the database queries for the analytics dashboard? This should be high priority.\nArjun, once Sakshi is done with the login issue, please write unit tests for the payment module.\nLata, please prepare a summary report of this sprint’s progress by Friday.\nAlso, someone should review the onboarding screens before the release next week.
